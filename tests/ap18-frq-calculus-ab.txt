1. People enter a line for an escalator at a rate modeled by the function r given by ⎧37
for 0£t£300 for t > 300,
where r(t) is measured in people per second and t is measured in seconds. As people get on the escalator, they exit the line at a constant rate of 0.7 person per second. There are 20 people in line at time t = 0.
(a) How many people enter the line for the escalator during the time interval 0 £ t £ 300 ?
(b) During the time interval 0 £ t £ 300, there are always people in line for the escalator. How many people
are in line at time t = 300 ?
(c) For t > 300, what is the first time t that there are no people in line for the escalator?
(d) For 0 £ t £ 300, at what time t is the number of people in line a minimum? To the nearest whole number, find the number of people in line at this time. Justify your answer.
