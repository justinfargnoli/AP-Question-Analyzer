(c) At what time t, 0 Â… t Â… 8, is the amount of water in the pipe at a minimum? Justify your answer.
(d) The pipe can hold 50 cubic feet of water before overflowing. For t ! 8, water continues to flow into and out
of the pipe at the given rates until the pipe begins to overflow. Write, but do not solve, an equation involving
one or more integrals that gives the time w when the pipe will begin to overflow.
